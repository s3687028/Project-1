Short Bio: 

Currently an online buisness student who also works for a tier one isurance agency as a trades liason, personally ive always had an interest in information technologies and its effect upon or social and personal lives. As a gamer and worker im intergrated with technology everyday and find it to be extremely helpful in automating small tasks and enhancing my current skill set.

Im australian born and raised with a cultural heritage stemming from Portugal, i speak both portuguese and spainish fluently while also learning japanese, korean and mandarin so that I may communicate better in an asian pacific focused economy not to mention my closet friends all speak those languages also. I adore animals and have a total of 5 "fur babies" they all mean a great deal to me and my human family, along with that I paint figurines as a recreational hobby.

Interest in IT: 

My interest in technology started at a very early age with my nintendo 64 and from there ive loved gaming. I generally use my PC to play games besides its ordinary uses. Ive been using and adapting to the technology changes since then and ive also built my own PC from purchased parts rather than buying a premade version. Besides that I wouldnt say I have alot of experience with IT, I dont know how to code or how to do anything advanced. RMIT proved to be a brilliant choice in studying online for buisness as it provided the optortunity to study at home using technology and had subjects focused around IT which is essential knowledge for todays world. Hopefully through my studies ill learn basic coding and some advanced tool tips as well as being able to store work and documents online allowing a multitude of people to access it for work purposes. 

Ideal Job:

An ideal job in my opinion would be as a investment analyst, the world of finance and investments excites me as its a position that requires a great deal of strategy and cunning and to me that is a true contest of intelligence. To be viable for a position such as that Id have to do a buisness course in finacial planning and work with a large amount of security trusts. After being supervised and a few years managing said trusts an analyst position would become viable. Currently im at square one in trying to achieve that end goal, I dont really have any experience or abilities in that field yet. However I am currently in motion to achieve it, the plan is as followed:

1. Graduate with buisness degree
2. work in a finacial sector for some years preferably at an investment firm
3. obtain an MBA
4. build a varied trading portfolio
5. apply to said job

Personal Profile:

According to the Meyers-Briggs test I am a INTJ an (Architect), the learning style test reports me as a visual learner and the big five personality test rated me with a high level of openess and neuroticism.

This has been a bit of an eye opener as Ive never really looked at myself from a clinical perspective nor had a look into my personality. It does reassure certain suspiscions ive had about who I am however. These results wont change anything about how I feel when working with others as I am who I am however I will try to be more mindful about some of the faults associated with be a INTJ while trying to incorporate my visual aides to assist my own learning. When forming a team I feel I should attempt to get more varied people who act on impulse and "doers" rather than planners such as myself as I would tend to over-think various aspects of work.

Project Idea:

Games for eyes

Video games, are used as an amazing multimedia platform to pass the time and enjoy thrilling stories, objective based activities and can even create innovation that affects much more than our tvs and monitors. Utilising programs such as PYgaze and openEYES ive devised a new set of games that allow people with cerebral palsey and other disabilities that limit the use of their finer motor functions to play video games that normally they would be unable to. Eye tracking technology has been around for a while now allowing people to turn eyemovement into electronically spoken words. Gazespeak has been revolutionary for patients with ALS and many other conditions and I believe we can turn eyemovement into regestered actions on a monitor that will also allw them to play games.

There are around 16000 people with ALS in america at any given time (ALSA.org, 2019), 17 million people globally are afflicted with cerebral palsey (Alliance, 2019) not to mention the number of people afflicted with any other disabilities that stop them from moving their arms and fingers. These unfortunate people remain locked in their own body unable to do many activities that the average person can do so developing a game that can utilse eyemovement would be in high demand not just from people that want to play the game recreationally, but also from hospitals and clinics that would use it as a form of therapy. It is a untapped market with a large potential to actually help people while generating a great deal of respect and capital.

The game itself will be focused around two primary genres platforming and bullet hell much like the very well liked cuphead game. The player will control a single protagonist and will move the character based on eyemovement. For example moving your eyes to the left side of the screen centrally will move the character to the left, upwards will make them jump, downwards will make them crouch and so on. It is at first incredibly simplistic and will become more difficult as the player progresses. Introducing enemies and boss fights as well as phyiscal traps that can eliminate the character forcing a level restart. At certain levels there will be puzzels that require the player to solve them using eyemovement. The game in total will feature 15 levels with a difficulty gauge that is able to be accessed in game. High scores and online leader boards will also be avaliable at launch enabling a competitive scene. Each stage will have a high score mode and there will also be an endless mode where the player is forced to continue with no end save for the death screen. The long term goal here is that we may be able to establish a competative scene that can be publicesed on streaming sites such as Twitch, generating revune and marketing. Of course ordinary people with no disabilities will be able to and are encouraged to play however the primary goal remains the same to provide a gaming experience to quadraplegics and the like. A therapy mode is essential to the game as a great deal of the game will be accessable to hospitals and clinics. A story will be included as the player requires a reason to continue playing, the players character will be named Saro and forced to solve puzzles and dodge enemy attacks in order to stop the "bad guys" from destroying the city that the game will be based in. It will be featured on both XBOX and PC both have software that can be arranged to allow a eyemovement tracker app to work. Assitance will be required to set up at first however with a great deal of technology now also assisting those who require physical assistance such as google home and alexa in order to turn the TV after the first installation and set up it will be accessable easily with the gear mentioned earlier. There is no additional controllers or keyboards for the game all that is required is either an XBOX or computer that is able to run Gazespeak and PYgaze type programs however a webcamera will be included with the game. The final product is named Eye runner. 

Gazespeak and PYgaze are the quintessential programs that will be utilised in order to make the games vision come to life. The game itself will be based off of the UNITY engine while following the cuphead format just without the need of combat. Gazespeak utilises the eyemovement and subtle facial features that the patient is making and will translate the actions into outcomes. PYgaze will act as a supplementary program to run stress testing against Gazespeak to see if there are any other optimal programs to use. The finished product will use Gazespeak. A (web)camera will be included with the product as eyemovement will have to picked up by some form of camera. 

Coding for the game will have to be written and the concept of eyemovement equating actions in game will require software engineers. The camera will have to be constructed also however ordinary webcameras will be able to be used by by the game if it is downloaded by a 3rd person party website. It shouldnt be too hard to find software engineers and game designers as these jobs have be rising recently (Bls.gov, 2019). Being granted use of Gazespeak is easy however gaining the rights to utilising it to make the software required for the game may be more difficult to aquire however hopefully microsoft will allow it.

Assuming the project is successful will set a trend for games to be made that suit those who are unable to utilise their finer motor functions. While larger more advanced games may not exactly be useable to them, within the near future they may get the chance. The answer to the boredom these people face may finally be fixed as I couldnt imagine having a disability of their nature and nothing to exercise my mental accuity with. I look foward to the future where hopefully video games are accesable to everyone.
