Short Bio: 

Currently an online buisness student who also works for a tier one isurance agency as a trades liason, personally ive always had an interest in information technologies and its effect upon or social and personal lives. As a gamer and worker im intergrated with technology everyday and find it to be extremely helpful in automating small tasks and enhancing my current skill set.

Im australian born and raised with a cultural heritage stemming from Portugal, i speak both portuguese and spainish fluently while also learning japanese, korean and mandarin so that I may communicate better in an asian pacific focused economy not to mention my closet friends all speak those languages also. I adore animals and have a total of 5 "fur babies" they all mean a great deal to me and my human family, along with that I paint figurines as a recreational hobby.

Interest in IT: 

My interest in technology started at a very early age with my nintendo 64 and from there ive loved gaming. I generally use my PC to play games besides its ordinary uses. Ive been using and adapting to the technology changes since then and ive also built my own PC from purchased parts rather than buying a premade version. Besides that I wouldnt say I have alot of experience with IT, I dont know how to code or how to do anything advanced. RMIT proved to be a brilliant choice in studying online for buisness as it provided the optortunity to study at home using technology and had subjects focused around IT which is essential knowledge for todays world. Hopefully through my studies ill learn basic coding and some advanced tool tips as well as being able to store work and documents online allowing a multitude of people to access it for work purposes.

An ideal job in my opinion would be as a investment analyst, the world of finance and investments excites me as its a position that requires a great deal of strategy and cunning and to me that is a true contest of intelligence. To be viable for a position such as that Id have to do a buisness course in finacial planning and work with a large amount of security trusts. After being supervised and a few years managing said trusts an analyst position would become viable. Currently im at square one in trying to achieve that end goal, I dont really have any experience or abilities in that field yet. However I am currently in motion to achieve it, the plan is as followed:

1. Graduate with buisness degree
2. work in a finacial sector for some years preferably at an investment firm
3. obtain an MBA
4. build a varied trading portfolio
5. apply to said job
