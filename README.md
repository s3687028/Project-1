Short Bio: Currently an online buisness student who also works for a tier one isurance agency as a trades liason, personally ive always had an interest in information technologies and its effect upon or social and personal lives. As a gamer and worker im intergrated with technology everyday and find it to be extremely helpful in automating small tasks and enhancing my current skill set.

Im australian born and raised with a cultural heritage stemming from Portugal, i speak both portuguese and spainish fluently while also learning japanese, korean and mandarin so that I may communicate better in an asian pacific focused economy not to mention my closet friends all speak those languages also. I adore animals and have a total of 5 "fur babies" they all mean a great deal to me and my human family, along with that I paint figurines as a recreational hobby.
