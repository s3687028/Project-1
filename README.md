Short Bio: 

Currently an online buisness student who also works for a tier one isurance agency as a trades liason, personally ive always had an interest in information technologies and its effect upon or social and personal lives. As a gamer and worker im intergrated with technology everyday and find it to be extremely helpful in automating small tasks and enhancing my current skill set.

Im australian born and raised with a cultural heritage stemming from Portugal, i speak both portuguese and spainish fluently while also learning japanese, korean and mandarin so that I may communicate better in an asian pacific focused economy not to mention my closet friends all speak those languages also. I adore animals and have a total of 5 "fur babies" they all mean a great deal to me and my human family, along with that I paint figurines as a recreational hobby.

Interest in IT: 

My interest in technology started at a very early age with my nintendo 64 and from there ive loved gaming. I generally use my PC to play games besides its ordinary uses. Ive been using and adapting to the technology changes since then and ive also built my own PC from purchased parts rather than buying a premade version. Besides that I wouldnt say I have alot of experience with IT, I dont know how to code or how to do anything advanced. RMIT proved to be a brilliant choice in studying online for buisness as it provided the optortunity to study at home using technology and had subjects focused around IT which is essential knowledge for todays world. Hopefully through my studies ill learn basic coding and some advanced tool tips as well as being able to store work and documents online allowing a multitude of people to access it for work purposes.
